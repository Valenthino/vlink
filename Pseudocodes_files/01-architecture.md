# System Architecture and Tech Stack

[‚Üê Back to Main](00-main.md)

## System Architecture
/*
This section outlines the fundamental building blocks of our application.
Think of it as the blueprint of how different parts of our system will work together.

LOGICAL EXPLANATION:
We separate our system into distinct components because:
1. It makes the system easier to maintain and update
2. Different teams can work on different parts simultaneously
3. If one part fails, the others can still function
4. We can scale different parts independently based on load
*/

## Tech Stack
/*
These are the main technologies we'll use to build our application:
- Next.js: A React framework that helps us build both frontend and backend
- TypeScript: Adds type safety to JavaScript, helping catch errors early
- MongoDB: A database that stores data in a format similar to JSON
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling
- Docker: Helps package our application for easy deployment

LOGICAL EXPLANATION:
We chose these technologies because:
1. Next.js: Provides server-side rendering and API routes in one framework
2. TypeScript: Catches errors before they reach production
3. MongoDB: Flexible schema for rapid development and easy scaling
4. Tailwind: Faster styling without writing custom CSS
5. Docker: Ensures consistent deployment across different environments
