# Monitoring and Analytics

[← Back to Main](00-main.md)

/*
LOGICAL EXPLANATION:
Monitoring and analytics are crucial because they:
1. Help understand system performance
2. Identify potential issues early
3. Track user behavior and patterns
4. Guide future improvements
*/

## System Metrics
```pseudocode
Function trackMetrics():
    // Keep track of important information
    Monitor:
        - URL creation rate              // How many URLs are being created
        - Redirect response time         // How fast our service is
        - Error rates                    // What's going wrong
        - Database performance           // How well our storage is working
        - Popular URLs                   // Which links are used most
        - Peak usage times              // When our service is busiest
    
    // Alert us if something's wrong
    If errorRate > threshold or responseTime > maxLatency:
        TriggerAlert(details)
```

## Performance Monitoring
/*
LOGICAL EXPLANATION:
We monitor performance to:
1. Ensure fast response times
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Plan for scaling
4. Maintain service quality
*/

```pseudocode
Function monitorPerformance():
    Track:
        // API Performance
        - Response times
        - Request success rates
        - Error rates by endpoint
        
        // Database Performance
        - Query execution times
        - Connection pool status
        - Index effectiveness
        
        // System Resources
        - CPU usage
        - Memory utilization
        - Network bandwidth
        - Disk space
```

## Usage Analytics
/*
LOGICAL EXPLANATION:
Usage analytics help us:
1. Understand user behavior
2. Identify popular features
3. Detect abuse patterns
4. Guide feature development
*/

```pseudocode
Function trackUsageAnalytics():
    Collect:
        // URL Statistics
        - Most clicked URLs
        - Peak usage times
        - Geographic distribution
        - Device types
        
        // User Behavior
        - Custom code usage
        - QR code generation
        - Error patterns
        - Feature adoption
```

## Alert System
/*
LOGICAL EXPLANATION:
Alerts are configured to:
1. Notify of critical issues
2. Prevent service disruptions
3. Enable quick response
4. Maintain service quality
*/

```pseudocode
Function configureAlerts():
    SetupAlerts:
        // Performance Alerts
        If responseTime > 500ms:
            SendAlert("High Latency")
        
        // Error Alerts
        If errorRate > 1%:
            SendAlert("High Error Rate")
        
        // Resource Alerts
        If cpuUsage > 80%:
            SendAlert("High CPU Usage")
        If memoryUsage > 90%:
            SendAlert("Low Memory")
        
        // Security Alerts
        If suspiciousActivity:
            SendAlert("Security Concern")
```
